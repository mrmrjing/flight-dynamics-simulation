# Flight Dynamics Simulation

## Overview
This repository contains the Unreal Engine 5 project for the Flight Dynamics Simulation, a collaborative effort to integrate realistic flight physics into game development. The project is a mix of C++ programming and blueprint scripting, aimed at simulating real-world aerodynamics within a virtual environment.

## Features
- Custom physics engine plugin for Unreal Engine 5
- Realistic simulation of lift, drag, and weight forces on an aircraft
- Interactive control system for aircraft maneuverability using keyboard inputs
- Integration of C++ with Unreal Engine's blueprint system for enhanced functionality

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Unreal Engine 5
- A compatible C++ development environment (e.g., Visual Studio)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flight-dynamics-simulation.git
```
2. Open the project in Unreal Engine 5
3. Compile the C++ code and ensure all dependencies are correctly set up in the Unreal Editor.

### Documentation 
For detailed documentation on the physics model and the integration process, refer to the report in this repository. It includes comprehensive explanations of the underlying equations and the implementation details.
